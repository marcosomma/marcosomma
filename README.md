### Hi there 👋
Thanks to Emilie Wapnick I realise that I'm a Multipotentialities!
What is a Multipotentialities?
Take a look at this:
- [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipotentiality)
- [TedTalk](https://www.ted.com/talks/emilie_wapnick_why_some_of_us_don_t_have_one_true_calling)

I have a lot of "interest", but mainly:
- Programming
- Biology
- Human cooperational behaviour
- Photography
- Build Robots
- VR/3D
- Music

Years of practice and knowledge about all those different fields push me to be an "out of box" thinker.
As Emily says, I think, I breathe and I live in the intersection area of multiple fields. This makes me more creative at the moment of solving complex problems.

### SOMETNINGS MORE...
Born in 1979 in Gragnano (the city of the real Italian pasta), from 2009 I'm floating around Europe, now living in Barcelona.
Fascinated by the concept behind the Teal Organisation, I’m also a fervent supporter of it. I deeply believe that the best way for a company to succeed is to have people that strongly feel the ownership of the product that they are developing.
From 2012 to 2017 I have been joining startups since the early stages. Then in 2018 together with some ex coworkers I found ABZU.AI. Currently looking for new challenges!
I consider myself a creative programmer. With a strong ability of converting ideas into prototypes and of course, the knowledge to develop them until the final product.
I love spending my free time with my family, my 3 kids and my lovely wife. I’m also bike addicted, so I try to match those two things… and it is not alway easy.
But, let me tell you a secret, when everyone is sleeping I love inventing robots with Arduino shhhhh.
